# THERE IS NOT TOKYO.

# Overview
"There is not Tokyo." is the most innovative and advanced web service in the world. I reimagined the border between Tokyo and Kanagawa. The result is more than just a web service. It's the future of the world.

This provides the solution to all people who are wondering whether Machida is in Tokyo or it is in Kanagawa.
